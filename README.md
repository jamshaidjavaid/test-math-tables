# test-math-tables
A project made in start of 2021 during javascript learning. 

I learned:
 1. how to hide and show different elements on certain events and occassions.
 2. how to use functions and build different questions and answers with Math.Random and Math.round, floor, ceil etc.
 3. how to validate the user answer with the actual answer.
